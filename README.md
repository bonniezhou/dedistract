# Dedistract

Stupid simple site "blocker" Chrome extension. "blocker" is in quotes because 
you can still use the sites, you just have to click and hold on a message for 
10s, which should help kill your muscle memory for opening up Reddit, Hacker 
News, or your Facebook feed.

# Installation instructions

1. [Download this extension as a zip file][2]
2. Unzip it
3. Go to `chrome://extensions` via the Chrome URL bar
4. Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button
5. Select the unzipped folder created in step 2

The source is simple enough that you should be able to read the whole thing in 
about 5 minutes. < 100 lines excluding jQuery. You can replace the jQuery with your 
own if you're super paranoid :)

To customize the message, edit the message at the top of `shared.js`.

Comes with builtin blocking of Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, Facebook news feed (still allows access to chat), and a bunch of stuff on YouTube.
